## Schema Definition & Scoring Rubrics

## Core Exploration

- Central Question (Semantic)
    
    **Definition:** The fundamental inquiry driving this insight - the deeper question beneath the surface topic that the person is genuinely trying to resolve, even if they don't explicitly state it as a question.
    
    **Identification Markers:**
    
    - Often implicit but can be inferred from what they're exploring
    - The "why" behind their observation or experience
    - The problem they're trying to solve through this thinking
    - The understanding they're seeking to develop
    
    **Examples:**
    
    - "How do we create deep connection without losing ourselves?"
    - "What enables transformation in stuck systems?"
    - "Why do some practices create lasting change while others don't?"
    - "How can structure and freedom coexist?"
- Key Tension (Semantic)
    
    **Definition:** The productive contradiction or paradox at the heart of the insight. This is the "both/and" that the person is trying to reconcile - two seemingly opposing forces that both feel true.
    
    **Identification Markers:**
    
    - Two concepts that seem mutually exclusive but both necessary
    - The "versus" that's actually an "and"
    - The polarity that generates creative energy
    - Often the source of the breakthrough
    
    **Examples:**
    
    - "Structure vs. emergence"
    - "Solitude vs. connection"
    - "Efficiency vs. humanity"
    - "Boundaries vs. intimacy"
- Breakthrough Moment (Semantic)
    
    **Definition:** The specific realization that shifted understanding - the moment when something clicked, revealed itself, or suddenly made sense. This is the "aha" that transforms confusion into clarity or reveals a new way of seeing.
    
    **Identification Markers:**
    
    - Sudden clarity after confusion or struggle
    - A reversal of previous understanding
    - Discovery that two things thought separate are actually connected
    - The moment when a pattern becomes visible
    - Often accompanied by surprise or excitement
    
    **Examples:**
    
    - "Yielding creates more connection than pursuing"
    - "The resistance IS the information"
    - "Structure doesn't limit creativity - it enables it"
    - "My personal patterns mirror organizational patterns"
- Edge of Understanding (Semantic)
    
    **Definition:** The frontier where clarity becomes uncertain - what the person recognizes they haven't figured out yet. This is where their current insight reaches its limit and points toward the next exploration needed.
    
    **Identification Markers:**
    
    - Questions without answers at the end of the insight
    - Acknowledged limitations of current understanding
    - Recognition that something works in one context but uncertain about others
    - The "but I don't know why" or "but I can't explain how"
    - Where confidence drops and speculation begins
    
    **Examples:**
    
    - "This works one-on-one, but I don't know how to scale it"
    - "I see the pattern but can't explain why it works"
    - "There's something here about timing I haven't figured out"
    - "This applies to relationships, but does it work in organizations?"
- Conceptual DNA (Semantic)
    
    **Definition:** The 2-4 essential concept-patterns that capture the core wisdom of this insight. These are not just topics or categories, but insight phrases that could stand alone as valuable understanding.
    
    **Identification Markers:**
    
    - Could be quoted as standalone wisdom
    - Captures a relationship or dynamic, not just a topic
    - The "quotable" essence of the insight
    
    **Examples:**
    
    - "Embodied awareness as relational bridge"
    - "Yielding as pathway to intimacy"
    - "Constraints as creative catalysts"
    - "Vulnerability as leadership strength"

- Insight Types (Semantic)
    
    **Definition:** The primary category of intellectual contribution this insight represents - what kind of knowledge artifact is being developed through this thinking.
    
    **Returns:** Returns a string with a single value from the taxonomy.
    
    **Taxonomy:**
    
    - **`observation`** - A noticed pattern or phenomenon captured without interpretation or analysis. Raw experiential data that caught attention but hasn't been processed into deeper understanding.
    - **`methodology`** - A reproducible approach or systematic process that others could follow to achieve similar results. Codified knowledge refined into teachable, transferable steps.
    - **`framework`** - A structural model for organizing understanding within a domain. Conceptual architecture that identifies key components, relationships, and organizing principles.
    - **`philosophy`** - A worldview or fundamental principle about the nature of reality. Core convictions and assumptions that underlie other forms of thinking and guide interpretation of experience.
    - **`synthesis`** - A novel combination bringing together previously separate ideas to create new understanding. Creative integration where existing elements merge to reveal unexpected connections.
    - **`theory`** - An explanatory model with causal mechanisms and predictive power. Systematic understanding of why phenomena occur, offering testable explanations that can anticipate outcomes.
    - **`question`** - Articulation of unknowing that opens new territory for exploration. Generative inquiry that reveals the edges of current understanding and creates space for discovery.
    - **`distinction`** - Recognition of an important difference previously unseen or conflated. Discriminating between concepts that appear similar but operate according to different principles.
    - **`hypothesis`** - A tentative explanation bridging observation and theory, inviting testing. An educated guess about mechanisms or relationships while acknowledging uncertainty.
    - **`practice`** - A specific action or embodied approach being developed through repeated engagement. Implementation-focused insight emphasizing experiential learning and personal discipline.
    - **`story`** - Narrative sense-making that constructs meaning and identity from experience. Personal mythology that creates coherence and significance through interpretive frameworks.
- Thinking Styles (Semantic)
    
    **Definition:** The characteristic cognitive approach(es) used in this insight - *how* the person is processing information and generating understanding, not *what* they're thinking about.
    
    **Returns:** Returns an array that may have multiple values from the taxonomy: `["embodied-somatic", "systems-holistic"]` for someone using body awareness to understand systems
    
    **Taxonomy**
    
    - **`analytical-linear`** - Sequential logical reasoning that breaks complex problems into component parts, establishing clear cause-and-effect relationships through step-by-step deduction.
    - **`mathematical-formal`** - Abstract reasoning through symbols, equations, and formal logical systems where relationships are expressed through mathematical structures rather than natural language.
    - **`systems-holistic`** - Pattern recognition that emphasizes interconnections, feedback loops, and emergent properties arising from whole-system dynamics rather than individual components.
    - **`embodied-somatic`** - Knowledge processing through bodily sensation, physical awareness, and felt sense, where the body serves as both source and validator of understanding.
    - **`narrative-temporal`** - Meaning-making through story structure, chronological sequence, and developmental arcs that create coherence through time and relationship.
    - **`metaphorical-associative`** - Understanding through analogy, similarity patterns, and cross-domain mapping where insights emerge from recognizing structural resemblances.
    - **`dialectical-synthetic`** - Integration of apparent contradictions by finding higher-order synthesis that transcends and includes opposing perspectives or forces.
    - **`intuitive-emergent`** - Direct knowing that arises spontaneously without deliberate analysis, trusting non-rational sources of understanding and allowing insights to surface naturally.
    - **`contemplative-receptive`** - Understanding that emerges through sustained attention, witnessing awareness, and receptive presence rather than active analysis or manipulation.
    - **`experimental-iterative`** - Knowledge development through systematic testing, adjustment based on results, and progressive refinement through empirical engagement.
- Development Stage (Semantic)
    
    **Definition:** The most relevant development stage for this insight in the intellectual journey.
    
    **Returns:** Returns a string with a single value from the taxonomy.
    
    **Taxonomy:**
    
    - **`noticing`** - First awareness of something worth attention before any conceptual understanding emerges. Pre-conceptual recognition where curiosity is sparked but no interpretation or analysis has yet begun.
    - **`exploring`** - Active investigation through questions and observations, gathering experiential data without yet forming coherent understanding. The insight involves uncertainty and inquiry-based engagement.
    - **`developing`** - Building understanding through pattern recognition and conceptual connections, where hypotheses form and relationships between ideas become visible. Active sense-making and framework construction.
    - **`breakthrough`** - Sudden shift in understanding where previously unclear patterns suddenly crystallize into coherent insight. Quantum leap in comprehension that fundamentally changes perspective.
    - **`integrating`** - Connecting new understanding to existing knowledge frameworks, weaving the insight into broader conceptual architecture and established mental models.
    - **`refining`** - Polishing and clarifying understanding through precision work, sharpening distinctions and definitions to achieve greater accuracy and nuance.
    - **`applying`** - Testing understanding through practical implementation, moving from theoretical comprehension to real-world engagement and empirical validation.
    - **`teaching`** - Understanding mature enough for transmission to others, with sufficient clarity and completeness to guide someone else's learning and development.
